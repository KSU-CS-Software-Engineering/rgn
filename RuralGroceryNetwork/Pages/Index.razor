<h1>Rural Grocery Initiative</h1>

<p>
	<br />The mission of the <a href="https://www.ruralgrocery.org/">Rural Grocery Initiative</a> (RGI) is to provide resources to help sustain and enhance independently-owned rural grocery stores.  RGI assists
	communities and citizens to strengthen rural grocery operations and improve access to healthy foods.
</p>

<p>
	This application is meant to aid rural grocers by optimizing their distribution networks. It takes in information about stores or other distribution points
	of interest and will calculate the best way to load trucks, the order to distribute to stores in, etc. The application gives the user control to manipulate
	nodes (a store or distribution center), trucks, demand, and more. To accomplish the routing portion of the calculations, the application utilizes ArcGIS
	Online, a service that can find the best routes between nodes on a map.
