#### Distribution Simulator
This page allows users to view different distribution simulations. Users can load (which will load in a key) in stores and generate radius on a map.
Routes connecting the stores within the radius will appear and are generated by ArcGIS. This radius can be generated by clicking on any location on the map. 
The size of the radius can be altered in the radius size box. As of right now, simulations can only be done with the city population variable.

Once a radius is generated a list of stores will appear along with a summary of information about those stores. Stores can be selected and deselected from the list, effecting variables in the Summary.
