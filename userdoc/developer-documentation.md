Blazor is a framework that utilizes .NET Core in building Web-Based Applications. It allows for the use of
C# in building websites along with HTML, though javascript can still be used as well. .NET
is one of the standard libraries used for Microsoft Applications, and has different versions
based on its purpose, such as .NET Framework and .NET Core. Blazor specifically uses ASP.NET Core
since it is useful for building web applications.

#### Blazor Pages and Components

A Blazor Web App is built on Components, which usually consist of a
UI Element that can be used repeatedly throughout your application. Some examples include
things like a single page or a web form.
